  <p>
    Why is The Bakery a special place to record? The live room in Studio A is
    why.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a 13’ ceiling and room dimensions of 25’x 15’, this room was made
    for a drum sound that will impress any musician. Careful consideration was
    made when designing the acoustics for this room. All acoustic applications
    were custom-made for Live A. You will not see them duplicated anywhere
    else…. Truly, it is one of a kind.
  <p>
    The control room in Studio A is centered
    around our API 1608-II console and our eight Neve 1073 preamps. Whether you
    want a punchy sound or a warm and fat one, Studio A has every color
    for an artist to paint with!
